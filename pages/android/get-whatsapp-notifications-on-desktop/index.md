If you’ve ever missed a WhatsApp message while working on your desktop, you’ll know how annoying it can be. If you’re using Android, **there are a few ways to make sure that you never miss a WhatsApp message again.**

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hcilab.projects.notification&hl=en">Download Desktop Notifications From Play Store</a>

Once you grab the free app from Google Play, it will direct you to install a browser extension on either [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/android-desktop-notif/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/android-desktop-notificat/giicnncicnopjohcpamieklkiacdoeni). From here, you just add your Android device’s unique identifier obtained from the Desktop Notifications app, and everything should be synced up. Now, any notifications on your phone will pop up in the corner of your screen, assuming your browser is running. As the app routes more notifications to your computer, it will detect the apps sending them, and let you disable them piecemeal to keep the onslaught under control.
